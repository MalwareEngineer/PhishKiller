    # Defaults are tuned for community / local-evaluation use:
    # ``auth_enabled=False`` lets ``docker compose up`` work without an
    # IdP.  Production deployments set ``auth_enabled=True`` (hardcoded
    # in the deployment-repo Terraform — see RFC §16 guardrail #2).
    #
    # When ``auth_enabled=False``, six startup guardrails (RFC §16)
    # refuse to run anywhere that looks like production: requires the
    # explicit ack token, refuses non-localhost binds, refuses to start
    # if AWS IMDS is reachable, refuses to start outside debug mode.
    # See ``darla.auth.guardrails``.

    # Master switch.  False = community/local mode (no auth, with
    # safety guardrails).  True = OIDC enforcement on protected routes.
    auth_enabled: bool = False

    # Required exact-string acknowledgement when ``auth_enabled=False``.
    # Verbose enough that no one sets this by accident or copies it
    # without noticing.  Any other value (including the default empty
    # string) causes the guardrails to refuse startup.

    #   Entra:    https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0
    #   Okta:     https://<your-org>.okta.com/oauth2/default
