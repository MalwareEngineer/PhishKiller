        canonical sibling (the existing pool-enum / CF-Turnstile-loop
        dedup pattern), AND
      * have ``sha256 == canonical.sha256`` (defense-in-depth — TLSH
        distance 0 says fuzzy-match; SHA256 equality says byte-equal),

      * belong to an investigation that's been ``COMPLETED`` for at
        least ``min_age_hours`` (24h grace by default — operators get
        a window to inspect freshly-completed investigations before
        bulky duplicate resources are GC'd).

    What stays:

      * The Kit row itself, including ``duplicate_of_kit_id`` pointer,
        ``error_message`` ("Sibling duplicate of …"), and all hashes.
        This preserves the audit trail that pool-enumeration tested N
        variants before convergence.
      * The canonical kit's files — never touched, only the duplicate
        sibling's directory is removed.

    What's intentionally NOT cleaned:

      * Cross-investigation correlation kits (status ANALYZED, not
        FAILED — different ``duplicate_of_kit_id`` semantics post-
        migration ``w3s9t0u1v2n4``).  The status filter excludes them;
        the same-investigation join check is belt-and-braces.
      * Kits whose canonical is missing or whose SHA256 differs from
        the canonical's — we err on the side of keeping data when
        invariants don't hold.

    The 24h grace exists because:
      1. Investigation completion can be wrong-and-recoverable (e.g.
         a stuck-kit recovery later resurrects a chain).  Don't GC
         until the dust settles.
      2. Operator inspection of a fresh investigation may legitimately
         want the per-attempt screenshots / requests.json before they
         disappear.
