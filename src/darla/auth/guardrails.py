"""Startup guardrails for auth-disabled mode (RFC §16).

When ``PK_AUTH_ENABLED=false``, the application MUST refuse to start in
any environment that resembles production.  These checks run once at
app startup via :func:`run_startup_guardrails`; failures raise
:exc:`SystemExit` with a clear message so the operator can correct
the config and restart.

The combined effect (see RFC §16.3) is that running prod with auth off
requires deliberately overriding all six controls — which is sabotage,
not a footgun.

This module implements the four startup-time prevention controls.  The
remaining two live elsewhere:

* Hardcoded ``PK_AUTH_ENABLED=true`` in production Terraform (infra,
  not code — see ``darla-deployment/terraform/`` once it exists).
* Healthcheck unhealthy-when-disabled (``darla.api.health``).
* CRITICAL log per request (``darla.auth.middleware``).

The startup-time controls are:

1. **Required ack token** — ``PK_I_UNDERSTAND_AUTH_IS_OFF`` must equal
   the verbose constant string :const:`AUTH_OFF_ACK`.
2. **Localhost-only bind** — ``PK_BIND_ADDRESS`` must be ``127.0.0.1``
   or ``localhost``.
3. **No AWS IMDS** — refuse to start if the EC2 instance metadata
   service responds (i.e. we're on AWS).
4. **Debug mode required** — ``PK_DEBUG`` must be ``True``.
