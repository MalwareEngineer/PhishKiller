"""Victim + observation business logic.

Two entry points live here:

* :func:`observe_victim_email` — the **sync** observation hook called
  from Celery tasks (oauth_ioc extraction, EML recipient parsing,
  AITM url-fragment extraction).  Filters by monitored_domains,
  upserts the Victim row, creates a kit_victims junction row with
  the source channel, and updates first/last_seen.  Returns the
  Victim if promoted; ``None`` if the email's domain isn't on the
  allowlist (caller is responsible for emitting a corresponding
  Indicator row in that case so the intel isn't lost).
* :class:`VictimService` — the **async** CRUD surface used by the
  PhishPrint API endpoints (list, get, update display_name / type /
  notes, query observations).

The split exists because the analysis pipeline is sync (Celery tasks
on a sync SQLAlchemy session) while FastAPI is async.  Each side
gets the right session shape without leaking complexity into the
caller.
