"""JS-redirect extraction tests for RedirectTracker.

The pre-existing ``_extract_js_redirect`` returned the *first* target
it found in body order — which silently broke the Microsoft OAuth AITM
trace on investigations ``bc4cd2d6``, ``b5a4f794``, ``66fbd412``,
``435ffd3f``, ``8f578dd8``.  Microsoft's 200 HTML body ships BOTH:

  * a real cross-host MSA handoff URL (``https://login.live.com/
    oauth20_authorize.srf?...``) — where a real browser actually goes
  * a same-host ``location.replace("/error.aspx?err=504")`` **fallback**
    that only executes if the JS handoff fails

The old logic picked the same-host ``/error.aspx`` target, followed it
to an empty HTTP 404, and misclassified the investigation as dead when
the attacker's app + AITM proxy were actually live.

The new extractor:

  1. collects ALL JS-redirect candidates,
  2. drops same-host dead-end fallback handlers (``/error.aspx`` on
     ``login.microsoftonline.com``, ``/err.srf`` on ``login.live.com``),
  3. prefers a cross-host candidate over any surviving same-host one,
  4. falls back to first-seen order as the final tiebreaker.

These tests lock that behavior in so a future refactor can't silently
regress to the old "first match wins" path.
