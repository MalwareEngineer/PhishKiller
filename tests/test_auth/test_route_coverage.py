"""Route-coverage lint — RFC 0001 Phase 4 default-deny enforcement.

Every route mounted under ``/api/v1/`` must either authenticate the
caller (via ``Depends(current_user)`` somewhere in its dependency
tree) or be explicitly listed in :data:`ANONYMOUS_ALLOWLIST` below.

This is the load-bearing test that catches the common foot-gun:
"new endpoint added, dev forgot the auth dependency, ships to prod
serving sensitive data anonymously."  Adding a route without a gate
breaks CI, not production.

How it works:

1. Import the FastAPI app to enumerate routes.
2. For each ``APIRoute`` under ``/api/v1/``, walk its
   ``dependant`` tree (the router-level deps + per-route deps +
   transitive deps each of those bring in).
3. Pass if ``current_user`` appears anywhere in that tree.
4. Pass if the route's path is in the explicit anonymous allowlist
   (just ``/api/v1/health``, the load-balancer probe).
5. Fail otherwise, naming the route so the failure tells you exactly
   what to fix.

To add a new genuinely-anonymous route, you must edit both the
allowlist AND justify the addition in the PR description.  The
deliberate friction is the point.
