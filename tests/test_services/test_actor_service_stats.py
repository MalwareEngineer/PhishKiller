"""Structural guards on ``ActorService.get_stats`` and the four
drill-down methods backing the rebuilt actor-detail page.

The actual aggregation SQL runs against Postgres-specific functions
(``date_trunc``, ``ARRAY``, JSONB) that don't translate cleanly to a
hermetic SQLite test, and the codebase has no existing async-test
harness to bolt onto.  Instead we lock down the structure via
source inspection: every method must reach the right junction
table, apply the right filter, and shape the response with the
fields the schema promises.  The full SQL behaviour is validated by
the live API smoke test in the PR description.

Each test pins a specific failure mode that would silently regress
the page if the refactor missed it.
