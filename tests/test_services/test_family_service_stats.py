"""Structural guards on ``FamilyService.get_stats`` and the five
drill-down methods backing the rebuilt family-detail page.

Same source-inspection rationale as
``test_actor_service_stats``: the aggregation SQL uses Postgres
features (``date_trunc``, ARRAY, JSONB) that don't translate cleanly
to a hermetic SQLite test, and the codebase has no existing
async-test harness.  Each test pins a specific failure mode that
would silently regress the page if the refactor missed it.
