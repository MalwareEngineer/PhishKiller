"""Cross-investigation SHA256 correlation behavior.

When two investigations independently render the same attacker
infrastructure (an AITM proxy serving identical bytes to multiple
victim chains is the canonical example), we want both kits to:

  * complete the full analysis chain (each investigation gets its
    own IOC / YARA / similarity rows tied to ITS investigation), and
  * carry a soft pointer (``duplicate_of_kit_id``) back to the
    canonical sibling so the campaign-correlation signal isn't lost.

The previous behavior collapsed investigation B's kit into a FAILED
duplicate with hashes nulled — losing analysis data for B and making
the kit invisible to SHA256/TLSH search.  These tests guard the new
contract.

Same-investigation duplicates (CF Turnstile re-render loops, relay
pool exhaustion, etc.) keep their FAILED-redundancy semantics — those
ARE redundant work, not correlation.

The decision lives in two places: ``compute_hashes`` (analysis.py) for
all kits and the dedup block of ``browser_download_kit`` (browser.py)
for browser-rendered kits specifically.  Both implementations follow
the same investigation-scoping rule; these tests assert the rule
shape rather than re-running the whole celery harness.
