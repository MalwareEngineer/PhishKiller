"""Chain-cursor recovery tests.

The post-download analysis chain interleaves the ``analysis`` and
``browser`` queues (e.g. ``execute_svgs_active`` is on the browser
queue at step 7).  Any queue-level intervention — a purge, a worker
restart, a broker reconnect — that drops a step task in the middle of
a chain leaves the kit in ``DOWNLOADED`` with the work that already
ran intact but no Celery message to drive the rest.

``Kit.chain_cursor`` records "step that started but may not have
completed" via a ``task_prerun`` signal in ``tasks/analysis.py``.  The
``recover_chain_cursors`` beat job picks up kits stalled on a cursor
and dispatches a partial chain starting AT the cursor.  These tests
guard the slicing logic + step-name registry so a refactor that adds
a new chain step (or moves one across queues) can't silently break
the resume path.
