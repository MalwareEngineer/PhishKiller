"""Per-investigation in-flight budget tests for browser_download_kit.

The browser worker is the throughput bottleneck (one Camoufox
instance per replica, 60-150s/render).  Without a per-investigation
budget, a single adversarial AITM kit with relay rotation could fill
the queue with up to ``browser_render_max_variations`` (now 10)
self-redispatched tasks, starving every other investigation.

``_can_dispatch_browser_render`` is the budget primitive — pure logic
over an in-memory ``KitStub`` list.  These tests guard the "is in-
flight" definition (DOWNLOADING + browser_render) and the per-
investigation isolation (one investigation can't burn another's
budget).
